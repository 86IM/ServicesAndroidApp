# ServicesApp
All types of services in one application.
This is my first project. I want learning Android, Java, Kotlin, GitHub etc.
I want to create OpenSource application that will help for some people find performers of all kinds of services and find a job nearby for others people.
If you want participate together - Wellcome!
